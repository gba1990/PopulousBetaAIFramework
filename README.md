# PopulousBetaAIFramework

Presents utilities that can be used for your AIs
- EventManager (so any of your scripts can trigger functions on the (for example) OnTurn, eliminating the need to onle have one OnTurn, in other words: hook/event subscribing)
- IngameLogger (to display log messages onto the screen, to allow for easier log visualization)
- FrameworkMath (extra math functions)
- Utils (well... more utilities: change Coord3D to 2D, create Coord3D from xyz, clone Coord3D objects...)
