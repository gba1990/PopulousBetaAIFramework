This code is thought for level 23 inferno of the original levels. It uses the original bullfrog's popscript
but adds the harvesting and dismantling behaviours to the AI therefore, incrementing their AIModulePopulationManager
when compared to their vanilla behaviour.

You need to link in the world editor this script to the level and save with the new format and that would be it.


        Population of the AI at 10 minutes mark with the different AI possible, where, vanilla is without any lua stuff
    Vanilla - With AI without dismantle - With AI and dismantle (every 256) - With AI dismantle (every 180) (three different results)
    36      -    40                     -    43                             -    48 and 45 and 37
    44      -    36                     -    44                             -    43 and 40 and 43
    39      -    40                     -    35                             -    40 and 49 and 50

You can invoke this method with the following:
    
    logArea(entries[1].centre, entries[1].radius, 100)
    logArea(entries[2].centre, entries[2].radius, 80)
    logArea(entries[3].centre, entries[3].radius, 80)
    
In order to display the areas in which red will harvest and look for trees.
Those lines are commented below (lines 68-70), just uncomment them
